Current development version
===========================

* Declare data members of UCT nodes and signature statistis as volatile.
  This avoids that the compiler reorders writes, which could cause crashes
  if the UCT search is used in lock-free mode.


Version 0.1 - 2008 May 30
=========================

Initial release. Compilation and functionality are tested on current Linux
distributions (Fedora 8, Ubuntu 8.04 LTS) and Mac OS X.
