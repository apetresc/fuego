    @section fuegotestoverview Overview

    FuegoTest is a GTP interface with commands from the Fuego libraries for
    testing purposes. It avoids that it is necessary to include GTP commands
    into the main Fuego GTP interface for functionality that is not used by
    the main Fuego player. This engine does not contain a player (although it
    may contain a switchable simple player in the future for simple playing
    algorithms, like random player, etc.)
