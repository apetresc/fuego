This file contains information about Fuego releases. It also contains a
(probably incomplete) list of the most important changes or of all
critical bugfixes in releases from a bugfix branch. For a detailed changelog
of changes in the main development branch, consult the version control
history.


Current development version
===========================

* Declare data members of UCT nodes and signature statistis as volatile.
  This avoids that the compiler reorders writes, which could cause crashes
  if the UCT search is used in lock-free mode.


Version 0.1 - 2008 May 30
=========================

Initial release. Compilation and functionality are tested on current Linux
distributions (Fedora 8, Ubuntu 8.04 LTS) and Mac OS X.
